        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3> <br>
        <h5>1.) How does the scoring system work?</h5>
        The scoring system is derived from a chess ranking algorithm and the amount of points you win or lose 
        is based on the level of your opponent. For more information, research the Method of Pairwise Comparisons.
        <br><br>
        <h5>2.) How accurate is the scoring system?</h5>
        Like any ranking system, the more you compete the more accurate 
        your score becomes. After 30 matches the confidence interval of your score is considered satifactory.
        <br><br>
        <h5>3.)What can I do if someone is cheating?</h5>
        After every match you can always review your the integrity of your opponent. 
        For serious infractions contact the system administrator (provided in the match contract).
        <br><br>
        <h5>4.)What are the weight classes?</h5>
          The number in each weight class represents the maximum weight limit of that weight class. 
          For example if you weigh-in at 64kg then you are allowed to compete at Featherweight 
          but if you weigh-in at 64.1kg then you must compete at Lightweight.
