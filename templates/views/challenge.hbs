    <h3>General Rules </h3>
    
    1) No unsportsmanlike conduct will be allowed.  You may be disqualified for unsportsmanlike
    conduct. The
    referee will be shown maximum respect at all times. 
    <br>2) No striking, biting, eye gouging (includes chin to eye), head butting, small joint
    manipulation
    (finger or toe locks), hair pulling, grabbing the windpipe, or ear pulling will be
    permitted.
    <br>3) No slamming allowed. Illegal slamming will be defined as slamming your opponent to
    escape
    submissions and/or to pass the guard; or standing from the guard and/or jumping from a
    standing position
    to slam your opponent. Slamming will result in an automatic DQ.  Takedowns are NOT
    considered slams, but
    you must deliver your opponent safely to the mat.
    <br>4) No infectious skin diseases (such as ringworm, staph, and MRSA) or open wounds will
    be
    permitted.  No lubricants, oils, or lotions of any kind will be permitted on any part of the
    body or
    clothing.
    <br>5) Competitors will be allowed to continue grappling anywhere on the matted area,
    provided they
    don’t interfere with another match.  If the competitors near the edge of the mat, they will
    be restarted
    from the same position, unless the referee is unable to duplicate the position for any
    reason.  In case
    the referee is unable to duplicate the position, the competitors will restart from a
    standing position.
    <br>6) If a competitor flees the ring when a submission is locked in and the competitor is
    obviously
    fleeing to avoid submission, he or she will be automatically disqualified.
    <br> 7) ALL matches are allowed to be recorded on video.
    <br> 8) Every match must have AT LEAST 1 Referee and 1 Scorekeeper. This is the responsibility of 
    the hosting school. 
    <br> 9) The visiting player is allowed to bring 1 Coach or Assistant to the match.
    <br> 10) The MATCH FEE for the visiting player will be decided by the hosting school.
    As a general recommendation, if the number of matches at the hosting school is 7 or less per week, the match fee 
    should be 0. If the visiting player wishes to join the class or open mat after match he or she will pay 
    the normal mat fee. 
    <br> 11) The match can take place before, during or after class. The hosting student and their instructor will
    make this decision. As a general rule, the best time for a match is during OPEN MAT or on the WEEKEND. 
    <br> 12) It is the responsibility of the hosting player (hosting player means the match will take place at your school / training facility) to discuss all rules and conditions of this contract with his or her 
    instructor <u>before sending or accepting the match contract</u> . 
    <br> 13) IF EITHER THE PLAYER OR HIS INSTRUCTOR BREAK OR CHANGE ANY OF THE RULES 
    IN THIS CONTRACT <u>AFTER IT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY BOTH PLAYERS</u> THEY WILL RECEIVE AN AUTOMATIC MATCH DISQUALIFICATION.
