                  <h3>General Rules</h3>
                  Note: Competitors, coaches, scorekeepers and referees should all be present least 15 minutes
                  before the match starts
                  in order to weigh-in, warm up and discuss the rules below to make sure everyone
                  is on the same page.<br><br>
                  <ol>
                     <li> No unsportsmanlike conduct will be allowed. You may be disqualified for
                        unsportsmanlike
                        conduct. The
                        referee will be shown maximum respect at all times.
                     </li>
                     <li> No striking, biting, eye gouging (includes chin to eye), head butting, small joint
                        manipulation
                        (finger or toe locks), hair pulling, grabbing the windpipe, or ear pulling will be
                        permitted.
                     </li>
                     <li> No slamming allowed. Illegal slamming will be defined as slamming your opponent to
                        escape
                        submissions and/or to pass the guard; or standing from the guard and/or jumping from
                        a
                        standing position
                        to slam your opponent. Slamming will result in an automatic DQ. Takedowns are NOT
                        considered slams, but
                        you must deliver your opponent safely to the mat.
                     </li>
                     <li> No infectious skin diseases (such as ringworm, staph, and MRSA) or open wounds will
                        be
                        permitted. No lubricants, oils, or lotions of any kind will be permitted on any
                        part of the
                        body or
                        clothing.
                     </li>
                     <li> Competitors will be allowed to continue grappling anywhere on the matted area,
                        provided they
                        don’t interfere with another match. If the competitors near the edge of the mat,
                        they will
                        be restarted
                        from the same position, unless the referee is unable to duplicate the position for
                        any
                        reason. In case
                        the referee is unable to duplicate the position, the competitors will restart from a
                        standing position.
                     </li>
                     <li> If a competitor flees the mat area when a submission is locked in and the competitor is
                        obviously
                        fleeing to avoid submission, he or she will be automatically disqualified.
                     </li>
                     <li> <u>All matches are allowed to be recorded on video</u> just like any other tournament. If
                        either
                        competitor or their instructor
                        interfere with this rule they will receive a DQ.
                     </li>
                     <li> Every match must have 1 Referee and 1 Scorekeeper. This is the responsibility of
                        the hosting school.
                     </li>
                     <li> The visiting competitor is allowed to bring 1 Coach or Assistant to the match.</li>
                     <li> It is the responsibility of the hosting competitor to discuss these rules with his or her
                        instructor <u>before sending or accepting the match contract</u>.
                     </li>
                     <li> Both competitors must weigh-in before the match starts. It is the responsibility of
                        the hosting school to provide a working scale and failure to do so will result in a
                        DQ for the host competitor. Either the visiting competitor or their coach/assitant may
                        request the scales to be verified by placing a weight on the scale.
                     </li>
                     <li> If a competitor does not make the weight outlined in their contract the other
                        competitor
                        has the option to reject the match and accept a win by DQ or continue with the
                        match.
                     </li>
                     <li> If a competitor arrives to the match 5 minutes or more past the Match Starting
                        Time, the other competitor
                        has the option to reject the match and accept a win by DQ or continue with the
                        match.
