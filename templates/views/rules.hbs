          <h3>General Rules</h3>
          Note: Competitors, coaches, scorekeepers and referees should all be present least 15 minutes
          before the match starts
          in order to weigh-in, warm up and discuss the rules below to make sure everyone
          is on the same page.<br><br>
          <ol>
            <li> No unsportsmanlike conduct will be allowed.  You may be disqualified for
              unsportsmanlike
              conduct. The
              referee will be shown maximum respect at all times. </li>
            <li> No striking, biting, eye gouging (includes chin to eye), head butting, small joint
              manipulation
              (finger or toe locks), hair pulling, grabbing the windpipe, or ear pulling will be
              permitted.</li>
            <li> No slamming allowed. Illegal slamming will be defined as slamming your opponent to
              escape
              submissions and/or to pass the guard; or standing from the guard and/or jumping from
              a
              standing position
              to slam your opponent. Slamming will result in an automatic DQ.  Takedowns are NOT
              considered slams, but
              you must deliver your opponent safely to the mat.</li>
            <li> No infectious skin diseases (such as ringworm, staph, and MRSA) or open wounds will
              be
              permitted.  No lubricants, oils, or lotions of any kind will be permitted on any
              part of the
              body or
              clothing.</li>
            <li> Competitors will be allowed to continue grappling anywhere on the matted area,
              provided they
              don’t interfere with another match.  If the competitors near the edge of the mat,
              they will
              be restarted
              from the same position, unless the referee is unable to duplicate the position for
              any
              reason.  In case
              the referee is unable to duplicate the position, the competitors will restart from a
              standing position.</li>
            <li> If a competitor flees the mat area when a submission is locked in and the competitor is
              obviously
              fleeing to avoid submission, he or she will be automatically disqualified. </li>
            <li> <u>All matches are allowed to be recorded on video</u> just like any other tournament. If either competitor or their instructor
              interfere with this rule they will receive a DQ.
            </li>
            <li> Every match must have 1 Referee and 1 Scorekeeper. This is the responsibility of
              the hosting school. </li>
            <li> The visiting competitor is allowed to bring 1 Coach or Assistant to the match.</li>
            <li> It is the responsibility of the hosting competitor to discuss these rules with his or her
              instructor <u>before sending or accepting the match contract</u>. </li>
            <li> Both competitors must weigh-in before the match starts. It is the responsibility of
              the hosting school to provide a working scale and failure to do so will result in a
              DQ for the host competitor. Either the visiting competitor or their coach/assitant may
              request the scales to be verified by placing a weight on the scale. </li>
            <li> If a competitor does not make the weight outlined in their contract the other
              competitor
              has the option to reject the match and accept a win by DQ or continue with the
              match. </li>
            <li> If a competitor arrives to the match 5 minutes or more past the Match Starting
              Time, the other competitor
              has the option to reject the match and accept a win by DQ or continue with the
              match. </li>
            <li>IF EITHER THE COMPETITOR OR THEIR INSTRUCTOR ATTEMPT TO CHANGE OR FAIL TO HONOR ANY OF RULES MENTIONED HERE
              THAT COMPETITOR WILL RECEIVE AN AUTOMATIC MATCH
              DISQUALIFICATION.</li>
