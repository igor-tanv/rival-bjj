          <p>General Rules <br>
                (General Rules apply to every match and cannot be changed)<br>
                1) No unsportsmanlike conduct will be allowed.  You may be disqualified for unsportsmanlike conduct. The
                referee will be shown maximum respect at all times. 
                Their decisions are final and will not be overturned.
                <br>2) No striking, biting, eye gouging (includes chin to eye), head butting, small joint manipulation
                (finger or toe locks), hair pulling, grabbing the windpipe, or ear pulling will be permitted.
                <br>3) No slamming allowed. Illegal slamming will be defined as slamming your opponent to escape
                submissions and/or to pass the guard; or standing from the guard and/or jumping from a standing position
                to slam your opponent. Slamming will result in an automatic DQ.  Takedowns are NOT considered slams, but
                you must deliver your opponent safely to the mat.
                <br>4) No infectious skin diseases (such as ringworm, staph, and MRSA) or open wounds will be
                permitted.  No lubricants, oils, or lotions of any kind will be permitted on any part of the body or
                clothing.
                <br>5) Competitors will be allowed to continue grappling anywhere on the matted area, provided they
                don’t interfere with another match.  If the competitors near the edge of the mat, they will be restarted
                from the same position, unless the referee is unable to duplicate the position for any reason.  In case
                the referee is unable to duplicate the position, the competitors will restart from a standing position.
                <br>6) If a competitor flees the ring when a submission is locked in and the competitor is obviously
                fleeing to avoid submission, he or she will be automatically disqualified.
                <br>7.) In the event two players of different belt levels compete, the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Gi Rules (see
                below) will automatically default to the lower belt level.
                <br>8.) In the event two players of different NoGi levels compete, the Submission Grappling NoGi Rules
                (see below)
                will automatically default to the lower NoGi level.
            </p>
