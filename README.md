# rival-bjj

Rival-Bjj is an application for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters to compete against each other in Ho Chi Minh City. 
A fighter can register to the site and, once registered, can ‘challenge’ another fighter. 
If accepted, they are given a contract with an allocated date, gym, referee, etc. 
After the fight, the fighter’s ranking is updated.
