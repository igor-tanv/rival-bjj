Lessons Learned: 
1. Multer Error: 
    The problem: scope of thinking was too small / could not figure out how to access Multer error with the provided function
    The answer:  Placed entire try/catch block within the Multer function to gain access to err object

2. MyProfile Page:
    The problem: Did not think of alternatives, too focused on one solution
                 Could not figure how to link two actions to the same route and stay DRY
    The answer: Used ternary operator to get the player object
