BIG PICTURE: Learn React and get some help . Cannot continue with hbs for long

--Look at Reclub's stack--

NEXT: 
Need to define properties for the following contract states: pending, confirmed, declined

Pending Contract: {
    opponent avatar,
    opponent name,
    match location, 
    match date,
    match style,
    match referee,
    comments
    *status*
}
*status* - If player is being challenged -> display Accept/Decline logic 
         - Else: show string "Pending" 
Alternative: split Pending Contracts into incoming and outgoing 
but that would require another hbs page

----------------------

Confirmed Contract: {
    opponent avatar,
    opponent name,
    match location, 
    match date,
    match style,
    match referee,
    match comments,
}

---------------------

Declined/Canceled Contract: {
    opponent avatar,
    opponent name,
    match location, 
    match date,
    match style,
    match referee,
    match comments,
    canceled by,
    reason for canceling,
}
















    
Move avatar so its side by side with other info
-> This indicative of a need to change the front end structure. Begin porting to React 


Lessons Learned: 
1. Multer Error: 
    The problem: scope of thinking was too small / could not figure out how to access Multer error with the provided function
    The answer:  Placed entire try/catch block within the Multer function to gain access to err object

2. MyProfile Page:
    The problem: Did not think of alternatives, too focused on one solution
                 Could not figure how to link two actions to the same route and stay DRY
    The answer: Used ternary operator to get the player object

3. Render Contract Async Function:
    The problem: Could not understand why an added object attribute was not showing on 
    console.log inside of async function 
    The answer: There are different kind of objects and some will not display their propeties
    with console.log
